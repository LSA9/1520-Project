	Tired of waiting in line at a so-called fast food joint or dealing with slow service at one of your favorite sit downs?  Whether you live-to-eat or just simply eat-to-live the answer to both of these questions is most certainly yes.  However, the wait for the web application to end your wait in long lines is over.  Gaggle is a web-based application that uses user input in order to indicate whether or not a restaurant is serving at a fast, slow, or normal pace.  Using the Google maps API, Gaggle will display a simple and easy to use map to show the restaurants in the users surrounding area.  When the desired restaurant is selected, the site will then display the restaurant’s information, which could include the line length within the restaurant, wait times for a table, and approximate wait times to be served.  
	Along with displaying wait times, the second most important aspect of Gaggle is user input.  Each user will have the opportunity to reach out to the gaggle nation and post information about their current dining location.   The user will have the option of inputting their restaurant’s line length or wait time approximations while also having the ability to post a comment in order to give more specific details.  All user input information will then be saved on gaggle’s offsite database’s, which, along with gaggle’s proprietary algorithms, will be used to create a best wait time estimate for periods where current user input is not available.  
	In order to create this minimum viable product, we will follow the 3 milestone system set up by class.  The three milestones are as follows:

•	Milestone 1: For milestone 1, our group will have a completed layout of all specifications needed in order to complete our project.  These will include all  logistical and technical requirements.  We will also set up the design of both our database and web site.  By the end of this milestone we should have a product that is usable by a user however will not have all the features of our MVP implemented.  For example, after this milestone, each user should have the ability to sign into our website, however may not have the ability to search for a restaurant or view and log wait times.
•	Milestone 2: For milestone 2, our group will have a fully functional site.  What this means, is that our site should look completely usable by our users however, some back end features like historical data utilization will not be in use.  By the end of this sprint, our users should be able to log in, search for restaurants in their area, as well as viewing and logging wait times.
•	Milestone 3:  For milestone 3, our group will have a fully completed project.  All aspects of gaggle will be completely implemented including all front end and back end features.  By the end of milestone 3, all aspects of our project described in the MVP description above will be completed as well as any other extra features we have time to complete before our hard deadline of April 15th.  

Along with the MVP, the gaggle team also has other extra implementation ideas which will be included in the final project if there is extra time after our goal of a completed project is accomplished.  These ideas include adding a top 5 restaurants visited list for each user, and ?????.  All of these amazing features along with our minimal viable product can help us begin the revolution against long lines or wait times at our favorite food joint so come, login, and gaggle along with us.
